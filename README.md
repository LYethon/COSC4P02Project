PROJECT SUMMARY:

We are looking to develop a user friendly dashboard and organizer which will allow students to easily plan their course selection and see all of their options, which Brock does not currently have a centralized location for. Students will be able to see their program details and requirements, an overview of courses that they have already taken, and a credit tracker.
